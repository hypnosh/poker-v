/*
Step 1: Declare Array of Objects with player details, i.e. playersBalStatus
Step 2: Filter for active players : activePlayers
Step 3: Sequence active players as per their turn in the hand : sequencedActivePlayers
Step 4: Betting starts. New array named streetBet is populated with the initial bets of each active player (in the same sequence as that of sequencedActivePlayers)
Step 5: Check if all elements of the array streetBet are equal. If not, more bets to be placed till the time the total of each player's bets for that street is same [Note: side pots yet to be factored in]
Step 6: With every bet by any player, the potBalance and the player's individual stack balance gets updated
